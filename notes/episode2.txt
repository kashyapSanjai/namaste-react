NPM dependency:- There are two types of dependency in npm packges first is dev dependecy and 2nd is normal or prod dependency. we need dev dependency only while developing the project.

NPX:- executing a package eg- npx parcel index.html

parcel:- parcek is bundler and we it use dto buldled the app. following feature it hs>>
Dev build
create local server
HMR = hot module replacment (refresh page on chnage)
file watching algo- written in c++
caching- by caching giving faster builds
Image optimisation - minification files
boundling
compressing - removes  all white spaces like things
consistence hashing
code splitting
differential bundling - gives older browser support
dignojstic - show error in beautiful error terminal
erro handling
https - support to host on ssl on dev server also
tree shaking - remove unused code for you
differnt dev and prod bundle


^ vs ~ (caret vs tild): when we use caret with np  version installing it will only update minor version of that npm packgae but using tild(~) updates only major version;
it always safe to use caret(^) beacause major update cause break our application


package.json vs package.json.lock:.json approx version of npm package and json.lock keep exact version of npm package

node_modules:- contains all the code of installed npm packages and its work like transitive dependecy that  means suppose if i install parcel and its has own dependecy and that parcel's dependency also has own dependency these kind of things called transitive  dependency

browserlist tool- its a vey good package ust explore this. we can define how many browser runs with versions and which browser eg: https://browserslist.dev/?q=bGFzdCAyIHZlcnNpb25z
