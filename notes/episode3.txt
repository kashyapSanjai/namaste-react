npm start = npm run start (both are same)
jsx - jsx is javascript syntax which is easier to create react element jsx is html like syntax and its not html inside javascript. 
jsx is not a part of react so we can also write react without jsx
jsx is not valid pure javascript js engine does not understand the jsx beacuse js engine only understand all version of ECMAcript
so how jsx working? its beacause parcel means code before reaches to js engine it is transpiled then js engine receives code that browser/react can understand  
this transpilation done by babel 
in jsx we neet use cammelcase to use attributes
jsx s very secure and  avoid cross site scripting attack so feel free to use jsx it automatically sanitise data and prevent injection attack

babel - this is a compiler of js it basically converts or transpile jsx into react code

note - transpiled means code convertd that code which browser/react can understand 


functional component - normal js function which return jsx
