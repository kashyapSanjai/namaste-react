monolith - written all code in same project like
    a.backend application
    b.ui
    c.auth
    d.db connection
    e. sms sending
    f. email notification
in monolith apps if we make single changes like change only button color so we also have to complie/deploywhole project


microservices - in this architecture we have different serviced for different job
    a.backend application
    b.ui
    c.auth
    d.db connection
    e. sms sending
    f. email notification
all above  small services Combined together form a big app all the microservice talk each other depending upon use cases also called it 'separation of concerns' and every project/services has different job and every service can be written in different language like bacjend in other language frontend in other 
que - how these service interact each other and deployed?
ans - all serviced deployed on different port but with same domain/url

note - incomparison of monolith apps microservices has different deplyment process for different services

useEffect - when the component rendered it and as soon as rendered  cycle is finished it will call this callback function
after every render of component useeffect called
    a.if no depenedecy array it call on every component rendered 
    b.if empty depenedecy array then useeffect called on initial render only once when component rendered first time
    c. if having depenedecy then it called every time when depenedecy changed

useState - it is use to create local state variable inside your functional components

note - dont create useState inside if/else or for loop

whenever state variable changes/update then react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component) react re-rendring whole component but react only update where value where its requires(chnaged value)
