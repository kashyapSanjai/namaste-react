Class components - its a normal javascript class and class base component are older way of creating components but in modern react we use only class base components. class compone ts has a render method which can return some jsx


Class component lifecycle - it has 2 phase for class component life cycle
    it has 2 phase first runn all parent and child component's constructorand render method then start to run commit phase
        - Render phase - basically in this phase  analyze new props ,state and find difference previou props and state (constructor and render method comes in this phase)
        - commit phase - in tis phase we update DOM (componentDidMount etc comes)

React class component lifecycle priorty with nested component
--------------------------------------
1.parent component
- constructor
- render
    if child 1 component
        - constructor
        - render
    if child 2 component
        - constructor
        - render
    child component Did mount
        - child 1 component did mount 
        - child 2 component did mount 
2.parent component Did mount

3.componentDidMount
4.componentWillUnMount




React Functional Component life cycle
-----------------------------------------
useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("trigger when component didmount initialy")
},[])

useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("trigger when dependency update")
},[state])

useEffect(()=>{
    return()=>{
        console.log("trigger when component removed")
    }
},[])
