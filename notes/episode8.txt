Class component lifecycle - it has 2 phase for class component life cycle
    it has 2 phase first runn all parent and child component's constructorand render method then start to run commit phase
        - Render phase - basically in this phase  analyze new props ,state and find difference previou props and state (constructor and render method comes in this phase)
        - commit phase - in tis phase we update DOM (componentDidMount etc comes)
